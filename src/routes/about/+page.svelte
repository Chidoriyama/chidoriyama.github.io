					The first reason why I made this team was because I wanted to make a team and I got the team
					name from Nishinoya's vball team when he was in middle school. I wanted to experience what
					owning a team would feel like. At first this team was going great untill we got hella toxic
					players and I shutdown the server. A few months later players starting asking me to rebuilt
					it so I did and we are much better than last time. Our team is growing and we are very
					active, on our way to 100 members. But I made this team for fun
